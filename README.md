# Capstone Project
## Clothing Swap Website
### Product Vision
The vision for my application is to address a demographic of users who have spare clothes that they don’t want to simply donate or put up for sale. These users want to be able to replace that item from their closet with something else—through trading with another user.
The website I plan to create is one through which users can sign up and create an account to begin listing pieces in their closet that they would like to get rid of. Other user listings can be browsed through, and through a messaging system, trades can be established. 
Some distinct problems this application would solve are:
- Having clothes that no longer want to be worn but can still be used by someone else
- Existing applications only allow selling clothing, not trading
- Promoting sustainability to keep clothing in use for longer, and out of landfills

### Planned Features
Taking into account the user requirements, project timeline, and resources, the following features are planned for implementation:
- User sign up and log in
- Clothing listing creation, including images and descriptions
- User listing browsing
- Swap request form
- *IF TIME, potentially a messaging system as well*
